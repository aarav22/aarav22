- 👋 Hi, I’m @aarav22
- 👀 I’m interested in Cryptography
- 🌱 I’m currently learning good coding practices (testing, typescript, functional programming), graph databases (neo4j), redux-saga (loving it)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all sorts of things but any ML or AI or cryptography projects would be really fun!
